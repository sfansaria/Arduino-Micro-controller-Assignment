# Arduino-Micro-controller-Assignment

The Arduino microcontroller is a powerful tool to build a wealth of mechatronics and robotic
projects. We’re just getting started - so let’s introduce how to work with push buttons and
LEDs. 

Tasks:

1 Blink Example
2 Push Button and LED
3 Digital I/O - LED Pattern
4 Digital I/O - Switch Debounce
5 Analogue Sensors - Calibrate Potentiometer Angle
6 Analogue Sensors - Measure the Output of the Sharp IR Distance
7 PWM Control of Actuators - Controlling a Standard Servomotor
8 PWM Control of Actuators - Controlling a DC motor, using a driver board
